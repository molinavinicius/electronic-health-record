## Summary


### Issue

We need to choose an ORM to manipulate the data from the database.


### Decision

I decided to use TypeORM.


### Status

Decided. 

## Details

### Positions

Some options are:

  * Prisma

  * Sequelize

  * TypeORM

  * Mongoose

  * ...


### Argument

I enjoyed better the interface, and I could find a way to create the abstract class for CRUD operations with TypeORM, and couldn't achieve this with Prisma.

## Notes
